### Some of the questions I investigated include:

### Transactions analysis

* Unique count and total amount for each transaction type?
* Average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?
* Closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?
* Percentage of customers who increase their closing balance by more than 5%?
* For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?
